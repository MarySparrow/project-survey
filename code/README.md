# Survey form with React

Goal was to build a survey with React with at least 3 question using 3 different types, radio buttons, dropdown, input field and have a submit button that hide the form and show a summary of the inputs. 

## The problem

It has been hard as I do not understand how to combine the components and therefore only used one. 
Most difficult is to create the summary of the inputs and how to collect the data. 

Stackoverflow, a lot of tutorials and read up on React has made it possible to accomplish this form. still missing a bit styling, but functionality is working as it should.
