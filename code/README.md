#Brief project-survey

Goal was to build a survey with React with at least 3 question using 3 different types, radio buttons, dropdown, input field and have a submit button that hide the form and show a summary of the inputs. 

#Summary

It has been hard as I do not understand how to combine the components and therefore only used one. 
Most difficult is to create the summary of teh inputs and how to collect the data. 

#Feedback 
- How can I separate the Form into components? 
- how to show one question at the time, best practice to do it?
